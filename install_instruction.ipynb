    "1. It helps you set up a environment for python (otherwise sometimes it is a littble bit painful if you're using windows)\n",
    "2. The virtual environment feature gives you the flexibility to switch between python versions of packages versions. You might encouter a place that you have to use python 2.7 for one project and python 3.5 for another, or version 1.0 (I made up this number) of NLTK for one project yet 1.5 for another project. Avoding installing them globally allows you to set up python environments for each project and not conficts with each other\n",
    "3. Unlike matlab, python is an open-source community. This results in an abundant and fast-developing third-party packages, which also means a lot of time you have to install those packages by yourself. Using conda can help you easily maintain those packages"
